Hey! Thanks for stopping by. Clearly, you areA wondering who I am and how much ofA myA writing can be trusted.

Understandable! Totally.

Yeah right, I can write any random stuff on my blog and add to clutter and make the already hard task of finding informationA ever harder. So here is a small (yes this is small) writeup on who I am and what I do. I'll let you decide if my information can be trusted.

I'm anA electronics and computer enthusiast.A I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. By the day, I am an Embedded Software Developer (last I checked) writing and manage embedded firmwareA for a living. By the evening, I am just another interested student looking for some excitement.

I know what it takes to write release quality code that is flexible and maintainable. I work in a product based company, we care a lot about long term maintenance of the product than the time to market. In short, giving attention to details and strict adherence to best practices just about covers my view towards software development.

I love any and everything related electronics, especially embedded systems. ApartA from that, day-to-day physics, computer vision,A algorithms, robotics, linux and ofcourse C programming are the next big things in my life.

My fascination for embedded systems dates back very early in my childhood. When I read all those science fictions with robots in them I used to wonder how they made the decisions. Then someone told me they had a computer inside them. From then on my question to people was how aA windows XPA can make things move?

> It's always the question that drives us.

I have no clue on who said that. I picked it up from the movie _The Matrix_ (not because it sounded cool). Nevertheless, I too was driven by the question. I mean how.. ? Okay I wasn't exactly the smartest person out there... not then, not now!

But then, no one can say I didn't try! least I had that. The answer then presented itself to be embedded systems. Well not exactly. But for the sake of this argument and for those few readers who are still with me at this point, IA will leave it at that.
