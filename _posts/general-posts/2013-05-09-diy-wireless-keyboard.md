I have a TVS eGold mechanical Keyboard. I was looking at some websites that sold wireless keyboard and soon found out that they were all membrane type. I have been using the mechanical one for quiet some time now and love it so much that I can't possibly revert back to the membrane even if it were wireless. Thats when I got the Idea to convert my mechanical wired-keyboard into a wireless one a DIY A wireless keyboard'.

I was reading about the PS2 interface and found that it should not be much of a problem. So the next assignment would be to make my own wireless keyboard. Hopefully I will be able to do it once these exams got over (yes I am having exams in another 2 days). I will make some kind of a tutorial once I make it on how to make one.. there aren't much tutorials on the Internet about this topic.
