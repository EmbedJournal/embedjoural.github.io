I have a TVS eGold mechanical Keyboard. I was looking at some websites that soldA <a title="Wireless" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">wireless</a>A keyboard and soon found out that they were all membrane type. I have been using the mechanical one for quiet some time now and love it so much that I can't possibly revert back to the membrane even if were wireless.A Thats when I got the Idea to convert my mechanical wired-keyboard into a wireless one a '<a title="Do it yourself" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">DIY</a>A wireless keyboard'.

So the next assignment will be to make my own wireless keyboard. Hopefully I will be able to do it once these exams got over dYtm (yes I am having exams in another 2 days). I will make some kind of a tutorial once I make it on how to make one.. there aren't much tutorials on theA <a title="Internet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Internet</a>A about this topic.
