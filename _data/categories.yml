    This is the primary category of EmbedJournal. An embedded system is a computer
    system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system,
    often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete
    device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many
    devices in common use today.

    Arduino has been the buzz word among hobbyist for a long time now. Arduino
    is an open source, computer hardware and software company, project, and user
    community that designs and manufactures microcontroller kits for building digital
    devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical
    world. This category focuses on content using or related to arduino in some way.

    what use is all these embedded technologies if you don't go out and make robots? This category
    will discuss about embedded system's most interesting application, Robotics. We will wire up
    some motors on to a chassis and write some software to bing the robots into life. At times, we
    do talk about some robot theory as well, be sure check them out.

    Microchip PIC had been my favorite in college days. Partly because my college had development tools
    purchased for the labs and partly because they were easily available in the local  market. This
    category has projects that were done with PIC 18, PIC 24 and PIC 32 series of microcontrollers. Some
    of these posts although filed in this category discuss some very basic embedded concepts. Be sure to
    check it out.

    Embedded Systems is 70% software and 30% hardware (IMHO). Most hardware bugs are overcome with
    software hacks/workarounds. Nevertheless, we have to get our hardwares up for the software to run
    This category has anything you have have to get your hands dirty. This includes anything from
    soldering to making chassis for you robots to things as simple as making a power supply.

    Linux has been the heart of the computing world since its first inception in late 1991. It has
    since evolved into one of the most apt operating systems for high end embedded devices. Regardless
    target platform, your development machine ought to be Linux even if you are a half way decent
    dev. This category is dedicated to tools, tricks and tips the Linux user environment form an
    embedded developer's perspective.

    Anything that doesn't fit into other more specific categories get thrown in here. But
    it doesn't mean posts here are totally irrelevent to the code theme of EmbedJoural, its
    more like a place where the authors can rant about tools, technologies and platforms which
    they really love or hate using. Check out these posts if you have the time for some tech
    rant!

    This category has to have been called software development, but for legacy reasons, we still call it
    programming. There is a lot of difference between the two and hopefully you will get to know a little
    about both as you browse through the content in this category. Content here will discuss about software
    in the context of embedded systems, so don't expect to see anything more complex than what an embedded
    device can handle.

    Occasionally we will review about hardware and software tool that we work on. At times, we review products
    on our own accord but some time, vendors send us development boards and ask us to review them for marketing
    purposes. Nevertheless, we will objectively evaluate the product and post out findings for our readers to
    make informed decisions on using or purchasing those tools.

    It is always good to keep tabs with whats happening around us on the small niche that we are in. This
    category will deal with the talk of the embedded world. Things that are happening currently and things
    that may be good to watch out for in the near future. There is no use going through this category now but
    be sure to subscribe to our posts to get upcoming updates in your inbox.
