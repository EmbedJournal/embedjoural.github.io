Linux is fast becoming the order of the day. Gone are the days when hackers, techies and geeks were the only people who could use it. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the Linux machines have also improved so much that one can use the computer without having to know anything about CLI (Command Line Interface).A This post will help you inA Getting Started with Linux.A Having the skill to work with Linux as a native environment, and being able to take care of day-to-day activities that you would do on a windows PC in Linux is a really essential for engineers.

In this post I will list out all the websites, and books that I have come across till now.

Most start ups and many other companies today use Linux as their operating system to cut cost, as they are opensource. Also the Linux user community has contributed a lot to the development of open source tool. So you should atleast be able to use Linux as an operating system and have no issues about it to be on the safer side.

This video illustrates how the Linux operating system is built how it is capable of having such a rapid growth rate. Also with the advent of the Android operating system (Linux based) it's popularity has almost doubled.



### **Links:**

Listed below are some useful links that can help you getting started with Linux as a user and become a developer. Keep a track of all or atleast a couple of them to have grip on what is happening in the Linux world and how to be updated with the current trends.

**The Linux Documentation Project:A **(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/" target="_blank">Visit Page</a>)**
  
** 

The Linux Documentation Project - LDP for short, or tldp (taken from the domain name) - is a very long-standing project whose aim is to document all aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system and associated applications software. The Project is governed by theA <a href="http://wiki.tldp.org/LDP%20Manifesto" target="_blank">LDP Manifesto</a>A and has a longA <a href="http://tldp.org/history.html" target="_blank">history</a>.

The LDP website consists of two parts: the first part is a collection of documents, mostly the famous "HOWTO"s, but also some Guides. This collection is available in many flavours, from html for online reading to docbook source for rendering inA <a href="http://tldp.org/docs.html#howto" target="_blank">many other document formats</a>. This part of the site isA <a href="http://wiki.tldp.org/Mirrors" target="_blank">mirrored all over the world</a>.

**Linux Gizmos:**A (<a href="http://linuxgizmos.com/" target="_blank">Visit Page</a>)

LinuxGizmos.com is a news and information website focused on using Linux and its derivatives in embedded and mobile devices and applications.

**Linux Security for Beginners:A **(<a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/index.html" target="_blank">Visit Page</a>)

Well this is not exactly a link, it is a book.

There is a saying in the security world that the only truly safeA <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/LinuxSecurity_Introduction1.html#" target="_blank">computerA system</a>A is one that is disconnected from the network, switched off and buried six feet under ground. The sentiment may be somewhat true but it is hardly a practical solution to the problems we face today in protecting servers and desktops from outside intrusion.

There are more computer systems connected to the internet either directly or via local area networks than at any time in the history of technology and the numbers are growing at a rapid rate. It seems that not a month goes by without another story in the news about theA <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/LinuxSecurity_Introduction1.html#" target="_blank">internal network</a>A of a major corporation being compromised by an intruder.

The simple fact is that there really is no such thing as a trulyA <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/LinuxSecurity_Introduction1.html#" target="_blank">secure</a>A system as long is it is connected to a network. If the large corporations with expensiveA <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/LinuxSecurity_Introduction1.html#" target="_blank">firewalls</a>A and talented IT staff canaEURtmt always stop criminals from breaking in what chance do the rest of us have?

**Linux Kernel Newbies:**A (<a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/" target="_blank">Visit Page</a>)

Kernel newbies is a community of aspiring Linux kernel developers who work to improve theirA <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Kernel" target="_blank">Kernel</a>s and more experienced developers willing to share their knowledge.<a id="line-2"></a>
  
Kernelnewbies can be found on theA <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/MailingList" target="_blank">MailingList</a>,A <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/IRC" target="_blank">IRC</a>A (irc.oftc.net #kernelnewbies), and theA <a href="http://forum.kernelnewbies.org/" target="_blank">web forum</a>.

**Linux Questions:**A (<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/" target="_blank">Visit Page</a>)

This is an active forum, where questions related to Linux are answered.

> Almost any question you may have (or will have), was already had and the solution was found.

So the first step before asking questions on forums, is to search popular directories and forums. This is one such place with a wide user community form all over the world. Member will not we very friendly if you post a question that has already been answered or if the solution could be easily found with Google. In any case, this is an awesome source of information for Linux user.
