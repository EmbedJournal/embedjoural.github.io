Today when I was hooking up my PIC micro on to a breadboard for a quick demonstration to a friend of mine, I realized how often I needed the Pin Diagram from the datasheet.

All this while I have been opening the datasheet and scrolling through to page 4. I don't know about you,A but, I bet there are a couple of people out there who did the same thing I did over and over again.

You may have made a screen shot and kept it as an image somewhere near by.. probably in the desktop.A If that is your idea, here is a good resolution image that you can consider,

Having the image on the desktop wont be of help if you are with the soldering iron in one hand. That's when this Idea came to my head, why not have it printed and stuck on the wall? well that would be more accessible than any thing you can think off dYtm, ( don't say you could have memorised the PIN diagram, I'm one of those die-hard Einstein fans who believes, "anything that can be recalled by reading a book is not worth remembering")

It took some time to put my plan in action, the datasheet image needed a lot of alteration to look good on the A4 sheet without loosing the resolution. I had to blow up the diagram in the PDF file and take 4 screenshots each with one section of the image and then reassemble it on Paint to get a nice big image.

After some touch-ups I should admit it looked professional dYtm,
