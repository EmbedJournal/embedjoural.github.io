TODO:
	- Add 404.html
	- Add lesser value contents removed page.

Notes:
	- Collection names do not seem to support "-" in them, use "_" instead.
	- collection names cannot be same as global variables (site.VARIABLE) as collections get get into
	  into global scope (site.COLLECTION) as well.

Issues:
	- Footer first link is treated as heading automatically. Make that a separate div.
	- Tags in post page has some UI overlap.
	- Author name in post page author widget is broken to next line before using the full line.
	- Social icons (sidebar, author widget, author pages) dont have any hover action.
	- make post list page category link hover to underline text.
	- post page top right date clip sometimes ovelaps text. Add a small margin around it.
	- footer about section remove hover underline. make it bright on hover. Same for all text links there.
	- numbered list typography has to be fixed. See, /glem-graphical-lcd-emulator-c/ & /contact/
	- block quotes are ave too small a font and has too much padding in the bottom. Fix this.
