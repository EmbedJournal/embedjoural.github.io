There you go! the age old thing to start off anything with. I don't plan on violating any conventions today.

Welcome to EmbedJournal! a tech blog on embedded systems, Linux, and ofcourse some random electronics.

I'm Siddharth, and EmbedJournal is my blog on things that have fascinated me over extendedA periods of time.A I've finally managed to organise all my articles form the internet-scatter into one roof. Hopefully, this will be their final landing point.

Like I said, the primary focus of most of my reading will be on Embedded Systems. But that doesn't stop there,A it's includes a lot of interesting fields such as robotics, computer vision, needless-to-say - electronics and a lot many more that I learn on a regular basis.

I will try to document all my future projects here. Hopefully someone somewhere will find it useful along the way. I may not be very frequent at posting content. But when I do post something, I will try to make it as readable as possible. After all isn't that the whole point?
