We love to hear from fellow enthusiasts, hobbyist and bloggers. But just before that, take some time reading the following guidelines.

**Guidelines for contacting us:**

Please note that authors may not respond to comments/emails/PMs that fall under the following categories,
  * Questions for which there are no obvious reasons for not finding resource online (ask god — aka, google).
  * Questions that obviously involves us writing elaborate code for you.
  * Questions for which we have already answered in posts or public conversations.

If you are still here, then you probably didn’t fall in any of the above traps. You can be sure that someone will write back to you. You could get touch with the authors using one of our social channels or you could write to their email. If this is not an post specific question you could write to admin [at] embedjournal [dot] com.
