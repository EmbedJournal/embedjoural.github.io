Hey! Thanks for stopping by. Clearly, you are wondering who I am and how much of my writing can be trusted.

Understandable! Totally.

Yeah right, I can write any random stuff on my blog, add to clutter and make the already hard task of finding information even harder. So here is a small (IMHO) write-up on who I am and what I do. I'll let you decide if my information can be trusted.

I'm an electronics and computer enthusiast. I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. By the day, I work as Software Engineer (last I checked) writing and manage embedded firmware for a living. By the evening, I am yet another hobbyist wandering the _free_ internet.

I know what it takes to write release quality code that is flexible and maintainable. I work in a product based company, we care a lot about long term maintenance of the product than the time to market. In short, giving attention to details and strict adherence to best practices just about covers my view towards software development.

I love any and everything related electronics, especially embedded systems. Apart from that, day-to-day physics, computer vision, algorithms, robotics, Linux and of course, C programming are some of my interests in no particular order.

My fascination for embedded systems runs back to my early childhood. Reading all those science fictions with robots, I used to wonder how they made the decisions, talked, and so on. Later, someone told me they had a computer sitting inside them running programs that do the logic. Then on my question had been, how a windows XP (back then XP was the norm) can make things move?

> It's always the question that drives us.

I have no clue on who said that. I picked it up from the movie _The Matrix_ (not because it sounded cool or anything, I just love the movie). Nevertheless, I too was driven by a question.

> I mean _how_..? _XP_..? really??

Okay I wasn't exactly the smartest person out there... not then, not now! But then, no one can say I didn't try! least I had that. With time, I found embedded systems to be the answer for all my questions. Well not literally. But for the sake of this argument and for those few readers who are still with me at this point, I will leave it at that.

If you are with me this far, you seem to like me (my work; please no stalking) a lot. You might want to subscribe to my posts and get notified when ever I publish something new.
