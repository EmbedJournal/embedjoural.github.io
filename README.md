EmbedJournal Jekyll Template
============================

### Installation:

* TBD in the near future.

### Notes:

* Collection names do not seem to support "-" in them, use "_" instead.
* collection names cannot be same as global variables (site.VARIABLE) as collections get get into into global scope (site.COLLECTION) as well.

### Issues:

* disqus comments page alignment bottom (whats app image sent to hadi)
* pre tag content should not wrap.
* code tag should not be cut in between when wrapping, see /shortest-path-line-follower-robot-logic-revealed/ where it happens.
* fix disqus comments button UI to match page nav links. Make it use up the rest of the space between page nav. In mobile view also preserve this alignment.
* bottom of post page does not align with bottom of side bar. fix this.
* when load comments button disappears, show our loading symbol and hide disqus loading symbol (if possible). This is so we show one loading symbol and comments load after that.
* image light box pop up should not have scroll bars in smaller displays.
* fix gallery width and height.
* fix copyright text kink link decoration to match other links in footer.
* Don't fix nav bar in mobile view.
* 2 column gallery
