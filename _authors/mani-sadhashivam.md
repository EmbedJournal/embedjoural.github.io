Howdy and Welcome...

This is Mani, an Electronics student who was fascinated by the world of bits and bytes hence made a career out of it :)

What do I love? In layman terms, I love electronics and its cousins :P. I got involved with the world of electronics just by sneaking inside of an old cassette recorder. Before knowing anything I hooked up ~230v supply to a capacitor inside it, expecting it to play me some random music for me...

But you might've guessed, that guy blew up. Well, that incident somehow fascinated me and as a result of it I chose Electronics and Communication as my Bachelor's degree.

Then I came across a subject called 'Embedded Systems' which told me how to control electronics by programming. Cool isn't it... Yeah...

From then my hobby, interest, career has been shaped with Embedded Systems and later with the Linux kernel.

In my free time I contribute to the Linux Mainline Kernel and advocate on open source technologies.

Here in Embedjournal I write blog posts on topics which interests me whenever I get free time...Probably I might be waiting for my patch to
get reviewed in the mailing list :D

Alright. That's about me and as all authors would say if you want to enjoy reading tech stories/tutorials, please subscribe to my posts :)

Last but not least, I love to do Organic farming and also a proud follower of Dr.Nammalzhvar.
