Hey everyone,

I have planned toA document all the small electronics projects that I do in my free time so that it wouldA be of some use to all the beginners of the sameA interestA as mine. I may not be regular in posting new stuffs, but I will try my level the best to post the mostA optimized content of what I have A done. When I was aA beginner, I found many blogs really useful, which actually made my learning curve smooth. I am no professional. (which I should have said a few lines earlier). I am a student and I am learning in the course of sharing myA knowledge. Any thing I say -or write to beA pressie- A has gone through a lot of thinking and testing so my posts won't be totally misleading but they may not be always correct.A Any constructiveA criticismA is always welcome. (that means, go ahead and punch me in the nose time)

I have seen and worked professionals of this domain, and I strongly believe that spoon feeding is one thing that spoils Engineers the most. So in this blog I will never be giving out entire code for the A project. So please donaEURtmt mistake me. I have learnt form my teacher that,

> a person asking for the entire source code for a project is just any other guy, trying to impress some one with his apparent geek-ish skills but not really or a developer/designer

But still I do believe inA knowledge sharing open sourcing. So I will try to give you as much support that it takes for you to to aEUR~_DO_aEUR~ stuffs yourself than just replicating what others have done. So if you are still having the aEUR~_where-is-the-damn-code_aEUR~ kind of an idea,A then I stronglyA recommend you toA GoogleA for some spoilers.

As you may already know Electronics is a Vast field of study for any one person to be fully well versed in all the fields it has, so I have decided to stream my thoughts and interest into a few particular fields such as the Embedded system Design, Robotics, Power Electronics and A computer programming (least to an extent up to which an electronics Engineer should know). So if your line ofA interest does not come into theseA category, then IaEURtmm sorry.. You are out of the scope of myA knowledge. But there are other means of resources. Continue googling until you find a proper '_trusted_' resource.

And lastly my observation over the couple years ofA scavengingA the internet, is that there are a lot if resources that are flawed. For example, there seems to be two datasheets for LM339-quad-comparator circulating all over the place.. dYtm, I am not trying to imply that my content is flawless, for that matter nothing in this world is foolproof (a lesson that I learned the hard way) A I am just saying that bloggers are humans and there is a higherA possibilityA of error. When it comes toA electronics prototyping and testing what the Datasheet (or spec sheet as some people call it)A says is final. Always [read the datasheet][EJ_LINK1] before doing anything with the component.

Lastly, in the embedded world there are a [lot of stuffs that can go wrong][EJ_LINK2]. So try to know the pitfalls before you fall and try to avoid them. For example, in embedded systems there could be a problem with hardware but you might be going round and round your software till you goA crazy -in-my-case- or just loose hope and drop the idea/project. The problem could be the other way round too. The worst thing that can happen is you might loose hope of ever completing any given task. So the rule of the thumb is to design the hardware properly with the proper design practices that should be the primary object of any designer, cause if you are going to build system and write its firmware and the 'hardware' itself was flawed... then there is no use going ahead. Be smart and '_work smart_', its way better than what they call the '_work hard_' analogy.
